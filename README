DESCRIPTION:

husky is a command line shell for UNIX-like OS written in haskell
and released under the GPL v3.

Please note that husky is currently in the very beginning stages
of development and presently used as a testbed for figuring out 
different ways of parsing input strings via parsec. Please don't 
expect a working release to appear until sometime end of 2009.
